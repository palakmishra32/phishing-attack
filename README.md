# Simulate a Phishing Attack and Propose Effective Countermeasures

This project demonstrates a **controlled and ethical simulation of a phishing attack** to understand its mechanics and propose effective countermeasures. It leverages penetration testing tools and methodologies to highlight the risks posed by phishing, a common and dangerous cybersecurity threat.

## Project Overview

Phishing is a social engineering attack used to steal sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. This project aims to:

- Simulate a phishing attack in a test environment using real-world techniques and tools.
- Capture and analyze results.
- Propose multi-layered countermeasures to protect users and systems from phishing threats.

## Tools Used

- **Kali Linux**: Penetration testing operating system.
- **Zphisher**: Tool for generating fake login pages.
- **Serveo**: Tunneling service to expose local phishing pages to the internet.
- **Gmail**: Email platform used to simulate phishing emails.

## Project Workflow

1. **Launch Zphisher**  
   - Generate phishing page (e.g., Gmail clone).
   - Example command: `bash zphisher.sh`

2. **Host Phishing Page using Serveo**  
   - Make local phishing page public.  
   - Command: `ssh -R 80:localhost:8080 serveo.net`

3. **Craft & Send Phishing Email**  
   - Include a realistic message and the Serveo-generated link.

4. **Victim Interaction Simulation**  
   - Simulated test user clicks the link and submits dummy credentials.

5. **Capture Credentials**  
   - Zphisher logs entered credentials in real-time.

## Results & Observations

- Fake login page accurately mimicked legitimate websites.
- Serveo successfully made the phishing page accessible over the internet.
- The phishing email was realistic enough to deceive a typical user.
- Credentials were captured effectively.
- Limited detection by email or browser security features.

## Effective Countermeasures

### Technical Measures

- Spam filters and email labeling.
- URL verification tools and link scanning.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- SSL/TLS enforcement (HTTPS only sites).
- Email Authentication Protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).

### User Awareness Strategies

- Conduct cybersecurity awareness training.
- Encourage safe browsing habits (“hover before you click”).
- Promote skepticism toward unsolicited emails.
- Enable reporting mechanisms for phishing attempts.
- Encourage use of official portals over emailed links.

## Conclusion

Phishing remains a potent threat due to its psychological manipulation. This simulation reveals how easily users can fall for phishing traps and reinforces the importance of combining **technical defenses** with **user education** to build strong cyber resilience.
